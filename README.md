# Note from me, chovypilled
This is a remake/reimagining of <a href=https://github.com/Yink>Yink's</a> Amadeus project written in Kotlin. As it was for him, this is just a side project so I might take longer than expected.   
  
 The reason I didn't fork the original repository directly is because the entire codebase is hideously outdated by now and working on it would prove far too difficult. 
 
 No, I don't intend to plug an LLM into this. LLMs never play characters well and I think using one would be disrespectful to Kurisu.
 
 Credit for the original project goes to <a href=https://github.com/Yink>Yink</a> and I am in no way pretending I came up with the idea of an Amadeus Android app.

<a href=https://github.com/Yink/Amadeus> Link to the original project </a>

Now that all that is out of the way, here are my main intentions:
- Rewrite most of it in Kotlin
- Update for newer Android devices, replacing deprecated features
- Add support for different screen resolutions and landscape orientation

Things I intend to work on later:
- Implement text input
- Improve on assistant features (launching apps, setting alarms/timers)
- Add Maho mode (looking for some help with this one! I need voice line audio and strings - ping me in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/fTtJ2Ws) if you're willing)
- Whatever other "upgrades" I come up with down the line.
  
Everything below is the original project's README.md, as it was on 2025/03/14.

# Amadeus
A side project that aims to replicate the Amadeus App shown in Steins;Gate 0 for Android.

I'm creating this mainly for cosplay purposes, thus the design takes priority over actual functionality.
Hit me up on the <a href="https://discord.gg/fTtJ2Ws">Steins;Gate Discord</a>.

To start speech recognition simply touch her once. If you long-click her, she will go on a loop and say random sentences in random intervals. Long-Click again to stop.
